Well video tapes and ice skates
Are beautiful things
Like a birthday card for Johnny
And a pair of angel wings
You were tryna light a fire
And all you wanted was a match
But you knew I didn't have one
So it was odd that you should ask
No, it wasn't just the plane crash
That shake you to the core
But the very thought of losing her
That made it all worth dying for

I'm sorry
I'm sorry

We both washed up on that island
All alone without a friend
Thinking you and I were gonna die there
And that would be the end
But as the weeks turned into months
I saw you overcome your fears
And as we became companions
All those months turned into years
We would talk and talk for hours
You would make sure I felt heard
Cuz you knew what I was saying
Though I never said a word

Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
I'm ready for anything
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
Who knows what the tide could bring?
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
Yeah, I'm ready for anything
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
Who knows what the tide could bring?

After fifteen hundred days
You and me escaped to sea
And I knew that you still loved the girl
From Memphis, Tennessee
Out there on that lonely ocean
We met a passing humpback whale
Cause all the way from Bakersfield
The tide gave us the sail
And just like that it happened
The waves took me away
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
That you lost a friend that day

Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
I'm ready for anything
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
Who knows what the tide could bring?
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
Yeah, I'm ready for anything
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
Who knows what the tide could bring?

Well you and me went on a journey
Full of tragedy and pain
But I'm grateful I was with you
Through the sunshine and the rain
And when I wonder where ya are now
I'll probably never know
But my friend I hope you made it
And somehow you finally made it home
I have an ocean-worth of questions
But if I do know one thing
Is that the sun will rise tomorrow
And who knows what the tide could bring?

Da da da da daa

Doo doo doo doo ooo ooo ooh

Hey, hey, hey, Kelly are you there? Pick up!
I know I said I'd be back
And like that
Nobody knew where I was at
And all my logic said "I would never see you again"
After four years, I'm missin' you so bad
But here I am
And now I have to learn to let you go
Even though I love you more than you'll ever know
I'm gettin' used to half a heart and the way things are
But Kelly, I never should've gotten outta the car
I'm sorry

Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
I'm ready for anything
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
Who knows what the tide could bring?
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
Yeah, I'm ready for anything
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
Who knows what the tide could bring?

I'm sorry
For everything
But nobody knows what the tide could bring
You know, nobody knows what the tide could bring

Videotapes and ice skates are beautiful things
Like a pocket watch on Kelly Time and a pair of angel wings
When the birthday card to Johnny
It made me realize
That the most beautiful thing in the world
Is, of course, the gift of life
The most beautiful thing in the world
Is to be so wonderfully alive
